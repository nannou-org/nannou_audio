## Features

Some of the features of this API include:

- [x] Access to the available audio devices on the system.
- [x] Spawn any number of input and output audio streams.
- [x] Simple builder API for establishing streams with reasonable defaults.
- [x] Requesting consistent buffer sizes for input and output streams no matter
      the back-end.
- [x] An easy-to-use, non-blocking API.

**nannou_audio** uses and contributes to
[**cpal**](https://github.com/tomaka/cpal) - a pure-Rust, cross-platform audio
library for handling the low-level cross-platform stuff under the hood.
